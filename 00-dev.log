_______________ GENERAL INFO 

The development style using Mercurial version control is discussed in the
docs, please see 02-hg-dev-stable-branch.html for details.

There are two branches in the repo: default and stable. The default branch is
for non-bug development, while the stable branch is for bug fixes.

As a developer, please add your comments here in chronological order. The
style is informal. Later we may need to write "official" documentation, apart
from the what's contained in the y_serial module.

Recorded TAGS will generally take the semantic versioning form:  vNmm.b
where N= major, mm= minor, b= bugfix numbers, e.g. v060.7
Your personal non-recorded tags can be created using the -l local option.
